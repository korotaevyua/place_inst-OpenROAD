# place_inst-OpenROAD

The purpose is placing standart cell to fixed location before placement in OpenROAD tool.

At first, place_macro command was tested, but it doesn't work with standart cells.

Then initial virsion of place_inst was developed, but some issues were encountered. So it works well only after placement. Because of that an additional procedure was developed.
